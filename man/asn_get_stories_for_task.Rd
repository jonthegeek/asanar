\title{Get stories from a task}
\usage{
asn_get_stories_for_task(task_gid, limit, offset, opt_fields)
}
\arguments{
\item{task_gid}{(character scalar) The task to operate on.}

\item{limit}{(optional) (integer scalar) Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.}

\item{offset}{(optional) (character scalar) Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'}

\item{opt_fields}{(optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return \emph{compact} representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.}

\value{
A story represents an activity associated with an object in the Asana system.\tabular{lll}{
   \strong{Property} \tab \strong{Class} \tab \strong{Description} \cr
   gid \tab character scalar \tab Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string. \cr
   resource_type \tab character scalar \tab The base type of this resource. \cr
   created_at \tab datetime scalar \tab The time at which this resource was created. \cr
   created_by \tab list \tab A \emph{user} object represents an account in Asana that can be given access to various workspaces, projects, and tasks. \cr
   resource_subtype \tab character scalar \tab The subtype of this resource. Different subtypes retain many of the same fields and behavior, but may render differently in Asana or represent resources with different semantic meaning. \cr
   text \tab character scalar \tab \emph{Create-only}. Human-readable text for the story or comment. This will not include the name of the creator. \emph{Note: This is not guaranteed to be stable for a given type of story. For example, text for a reassignment may not always say “assigned to …” as the text for a story can both be edited and change based on the language settings of the user making the request.} Use the \code{resource_subtype} property to discover the action that created the story. \cr
