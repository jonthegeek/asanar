\title{Get a custom field}
\usage{
asn_get_custom_field(custom_field_gid, opt_fields)
}
\arguments{
\item{custom_field_gid}{(character scalar) Globally unique identifier for the custom field.}

\item{opt_fields}{(optional) (character vector) Defines fields to return. Some requests return \emph{compact} representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.}
}
\value{
A generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.
}
\description{
Get the complete definition of a custom fieldâ€™s metadata.  Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, enum_options is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these type-specific custom field definitions.
