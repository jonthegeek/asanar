#' Get tasks from a user task list
#'
#' Returns the compact list of tasks in a user’s My Tasks list. *Note: Access control is enforced for this endpoint as with all Asana API endpoints, meaning a user’s private tasks will be filtered out if the API-authenticated user does not have access to them.* *Note: Both complete and incomplete tasks are returned by default unless they are filtered out (for example, setting `completed_since=now` will return only incomplete tasks, which is the default view for “My Tasks” in Asana.)*
#'
#' @param user_task_list_gid (character scalar) Globally unique identifier for the user task list.
#' @param completed_since (optional) (character scalar) Only return tasks that are either incomplete or that have been completed since this time. Accepts a date-time string or the keyword *now*.
#' @param limit (optional) (integer scalar) Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
#' @param offset (optional) (character scalar) Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
#'
#' @return The *task* is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are centered.
#' | **Property** | **Class** | **Description** |
#' |:-------------|:----------|:----------------|
#' | gid | character scalar | Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string. |
#' | resource_type | character scalar | The base type of this resource. |
#' | name | character scalar | The name of the task. |
#' | resource_subtype | character scalar | The subtype of this resource. Different subtypes retain many of the same fields and behavior, but may render differently in Asana or represent resources with different semantic meaning. The resource_subtype `milestone` represent a single moment in time. This means tasks with this subtype cannot have a start_date. |
