#' Create an organization export request
#'
#' This method creates a request to export an Organization. Asana will complete the export at some point after you create the request.
#'
#' @param limit (optional) (integer scalar) Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
#' @param offset (optional) (character scalar) Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
#'
#' @return An *organization_export* object represents a request to export the complete data of an Organization in JSON format.
#' | **Property** | **Class** | **Description** |
#' |:-------------|:----------|:----------------|
#' | gid | character scalar | Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string. |
#' | resource_type | character scalar | The base type of this resource. |
#' | created_at | datetime scalar | The time at which this resource was created. |
#' | download_url | character scalar | Download this URL to retreive the full export of the organization in JSON format. It will be compressed in a gzip (.gz) container.  *Note: May be null if the export is still in progress or failed.  If present, this URL may only be valid for 1 hour from the time of retrieval. You should avoid persisting this URL somewhere and rather refresh on demand to ensure you do not keep stale URLs.* |
#' | organization | list | A *workspace* is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All projects and tasks have an associated workspace. |
#' | state | character scalar | The current state of the export. |
