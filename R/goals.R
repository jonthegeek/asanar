#' Remove a collaborator from a goal
#'
#' Removes followers from a goal. Returns the goal the followers were removed from. Each goal can be associated with zero or more followers in the system. Requests to add/remove followers, if successful, will return the complete updated goal record, described above.
#'
#' @param goal_gid (character scalar) Globally unique identifier for the goal.
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

#' @return A generic Asana Resource, containing a globally unique identifier.
#' | **Property** | **Class** | **Description** |
#' |:-------------|:----------|:----------------|
#' | gid | character scalar | Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string. |
#' | resource_type | character scalar | The base type of this resource. |
#' | due_on | character scalar | The localized day on which this goal is due. This takes a date with format `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
#' | html_notes | character scalar | The notes of the goal with formatting as HTML. |
#' | is_workspace_level | logical scalar | *Conditional*. This property is only present when the `workspace` provided is an organization. Whether the goal belongs to the `workspace` (and is listed as part of the workspace’s goals) or not. If it isn’t a workspace-level goal, it is a team-level goal, and is associated with the goal’s team. |
#' | liked | logical scalar | True if the goal is liked by the authorized user, false if not. |
#' | name | character scalar | The name of the goal. |
#' | notes | character scalar | Free-form textual information associated with the goal (i.e. its description). |
#' | start_on | character scalar | The day on which work for this goal begins, or null if the goal has no start date. This takes a date with `YYYY-MM-DD` format, and cannot be set unless there is an accompanying due date. |
#' | status | character scalar | The current status of this goal. When the goal is open, its status can be `green`, `yellow`, and `red` to reflect "On Track", "At Risk", and "Off Track", respectively. When the goal is closed, the value can be `missed`, `achieved`, `partial`, or `dropped`. *Note* you can only write to this property if `metric` is set. |
#' | current_status_update | list | The latest `status_update` posted to this goal. |
