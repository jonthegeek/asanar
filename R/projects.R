#' Get a project's custom fields
#'
#' Returns a list of all of the custom fields settings on a project, in compact form. Note that, as in all queries to collections which return compact representation, `opt_fields` can be used to include more data than is returned in the compact representation. See the [getting started guide on input/output options](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#input-output-options) for more information.
#'
#' @param project_gid (character scalar) Globally unique identifier for the project.
#' @param limit (optional) (integer scalar) Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
#' @param offset (optional) (character scalar) Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

#' Create a project template from a project
#'
#' Creates and returns a job that will asynchronously handle the project template creation. Note that while the resulting project template can be accessed with the API, it won't be visible in the Asana UI until Project Templates 2.0 is launched in the app. See more in [this forum post](https://forum.asana.com/t/a-new-api-for-project-templates/156432).

#' @param project_gid (character scalar) Globally unique identifier for the project.
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

#' | new_task | list | The *task* is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are centered. |
#' | resource_subtype | character scalar | The subtype of this resource. Different subtypes retain many of the same fields and behavior, but may render differently in Asana or represent resources with different semantic meaning. |
#' | status | character scalar | The current status of this job. The value is one of: `not_started`, `in_progress`, `succeeded`, or `failed`. |
