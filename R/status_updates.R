#' Get a status update
#'
#' Returns the complete record for a single status update.
#'
#' @param status_gid (character scalar) The status update to get.
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
#'
#' @return A *status update* is an update on the progress of a particular project, portfolio, or goal, and is sent out to all of its parent's followers when created. These updates include both text describing the update and a `status_type` intended to represent the overall state of the project.
