#' Get multiple webhooks
#'
#' Get the compact representation of all webhooks your app has registered for the authenticated user in the given workspace.
#'
#' @param limit (optional) (integer scalar) Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
#' @param offset (optional) (character scalar) Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
#' @param resource (optional) (character scalar) Only return webhooks for the given resource.
#' @param workspace (character scalar) The workspace to query for webhooks in.
#'
#' @return Webhook objects represent the state of an active subscription for a server to be updated with information from Asana. This schema represents the subscription itself, not the objects that are sent to the server. For information on those please refer to the [event](https://developers.asana.com/reference/events) schema.

#' Establish a webhook
#'
#' Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.  Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.  The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhookâ€™s confirmation handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).  Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code.  ``` # Request curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <personal_access_token>" \ -X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \ -d "resource=8675309" \ -d "target=https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654" ```  ``` # Handshake sent to https://example.com/ POST /receive-webhook/7654 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 ```  ``` # Handshake response sent by example.com HTTP/1.1 200 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 ```  ``` # Response HTTP/1.1 201 {   "data": {     "gid": "43214",     "resource": {       "gid": "8675309",       "name": "Bugs"     },     "target": "https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654",     "active": false,     "last_success_at": null,     "last_failure_at": null,     "last_failure_content": null   } } ```
