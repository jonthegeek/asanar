#' Get a team membership
#'
#' Returns the complete team membership record for a single team membership.
#'
#' @param team_membership_gid (character scalar) NA
#' @param opt_fields (optional) (list) Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
#'
#' @return This object represents a user's connection to a team.
#' | **Property** | **Class** | **Description** |
#' |:-------------|:----------|:----------------|
#' | gid | character scalar | Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string. |
#' | resource_type | character scalar | The base type of this resource. |
#' | is_admin | logical scalar | Describes if the user is a team admin. |
#' | is_guest | logical scalar | Describes if the user is a guest in the team. |
#' | is_limited_access | logical scalar | Describes if the user has limited access to the team. |
#' | team | list | A *team* is used to group related projects and people together within an organization. Each project in an organization is associated with a team. |
#' | user | list | A *user* object represents an account in Asana that can be given access to various workspaces, projects, and tasks. |

#' Get team memberships
#'
#' Returns compact team membership records.
#'
#' @param limit (optional) (integer scalar) Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
#' @param offset (optional) (character scalar) Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.'

#' @param team (optional) (character scalar) Globally unique identifier for the team.
#' @param user (optional) (character scalar) A string identifying a user. This can either be the string "me", an email, or the gid of a user. This parameter must be used with the workspace parameter.
#' @param workspace (optional) (character scalar) Globally unique identifier for the workspace. This parameter must be used with the user parameter.
